I am Machine Learning and Deep Learning practitioner particulary focused in Computer Vision. I have accomplished various Deep Learning projects in TensorFlow, Keras frameworks using Python.



Technology runs our lives these days. Smartphones, tablets and computers – we really can’t seem to function without them. In a very short amount of time, technology has exploded in the market and now, many people cannot imagine a life without it.  

All technologies are born out of purpose. For example, search engines were created to sort through the massive amounts of data online. With each new upgrade technology compounds existing technologies to create something better than what was previously used before. And on and on it goes.
